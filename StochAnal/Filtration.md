$\sigma$-algebras have a nice interpretation as a set containing "information"
For example, we can interpret the filtration _generated_ by a [[Stochastic process |stochastic process]] $X_t$ (i.e. the smallest filtration in which the process is measurable) as "information obtained by observing the process X".

**Definition**
1. A **filtration** is a family of increasing (wrt inclusion ordering) sub-$\sigma$-algebras of $\mathcal{F}$
2. A stochastic process X is **adapted** to the filtration $(\mathcal{F}_t)$ if $\forall t; X_t$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable
