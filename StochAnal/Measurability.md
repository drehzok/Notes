**Definitions**
1. $\sigma$-**algebra** $\mathcal{F}$ on set $\Omega$ is a set of subsets of $\Omega$ such that it is closed under union and complement, and also $\emptyset,\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$
2. A **probability space** is a measurable space (a set with $\sigma$-algebra) with a **probability measure** $\mathbb{P}:\mathcal{F} \to [0,1]$ 
3. A **random variable** is a ....

**Remarks**
1. Why do we require a random variable to be compatible with the measure?
	* because we want to talk about the **probability law** of a random variable
