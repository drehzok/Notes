**Definitions**
1. $\sigma$-**algebra** $\mathcal{F}$ on set $\Omega$ is a set of subsets of $\Omega$ such that it is closed under union and complement, and also $\emptyset,\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$
2. A **probability space** is a measurable space (a set with $\sigma$-algebra) with a **probability measure** $\mathbb{P}:\mathcal{F} \to [0,1]$ 
3. A **random variable** is a ....

**Remarks**
1. Why do we require a random variable to be compatible with the measure?
	* because we want to talk about the **probability law** of a random variable
2. $\sigma$-algebras can be interpreted as the _information_ available at that time
	* $A\in \mathcal{F}^X_t$ means that an observer knows whether $A$ has occurred or not by observing process $X$
	* $\mathcal{F}^X_t$ is the minimal $\sigma$-algebra in which $X_t$ is measurable - in other words, the info generated by _observing_ $X$ up to time $t$

#### Progressively measurable process
A [[Stochastic process|process]] $X$ is **progressively measurable** w.r.t. $(\mathcal{F}_t)$ if $\forall t \geq 0, A\in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d)$
$$
\{(s,\omega); 0\leq s \leq t, \omega \in \Omega, X_s(\omega)\in A \} \in \mathcal{B}([0,t])\otimes\mathcal{F_t}
$$
i.e. $X:[0,t]\times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^d$ is measurable $\forall t\geq 0$

Then we have a natural question: 
* progressively measurable $\Leftrightarrow$ measurable & adapted?
Answer:
* Yes, but we need to encounter measure-zero, so there are 2 ways in dealing with them:
	1. Augmented filtration: extension of filtration by adding null sets
	2. Measurable & adapted $\Rightarrow$ has a progressively measurable *modification*
