Recall from [[Path space]] that $W_T=W_T(\mathbb{R}^d)$ (continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$) can be endowed with the uniform convergence topology.

**Wiener's theorem.** $\exists !\mu_T$ on $W_T$ satisfying

**Definition**
1. **Wiener space** is a _probability space_ $(W_T, \mathcal{B}(W_T),\mu_T)$ where the measure is called **Wiener measure** and the random variables are called **Wiener functionals** (see [[Stochastic process]])
