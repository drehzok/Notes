Let $(E, d_E)$ be a complete separable metric space, then
$W_T(E):=C^0([0,T]\to E)$ is endowed with the **topology of uniform convergence** (i.e. complete separable metric space).

Consequently, $W(E):=W_{[0,\infty)}(E)$ is endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets (i.e. complete separable metric space).
